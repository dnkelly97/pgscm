## Prospective Gradute Student Recruitment

The Prospective Graduate Recruitment platform will serve as a resource manager for keeping track of prospective graduate students and their interactions with the college. This platform will receive and maintain information on each prospective student. This information will include things like the student's major(s), expected graduation date, GPA, GRE results, what college they attended as an undergraduate, research interests, what degree they are interested in, which other schools they are looking at, where they rank UofI on their list of interests, whether they've responded to emails, and whether they've visited UofI. 

### Motivation

With current alternatives relying primarily on the use of Excel sheets it is important to come up with a more focused and user-friendly SaaS application whose primary purpose is to address this specific task. Making this tool stands to benefit the recuiter whose time can be spent more efficiently with an easier and more straight-forward interface to work with. This application would be a centralized and adaptable for use all across the University of Iowa in case many different departments needed to use it at the same time.
