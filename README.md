The Prospective Graduate Recruitment platform will serve as a resource manager for keeping track of prospective graduate students and their interactions with the college. This 
platform will receive and maintain information on each prospective student. This information will include things like the student's major(s), expected graduation date, GPA, 
GRE results, what college they attended as an undergraduate, research interests, what degree they are interested in, which other schools they are looking at, 
where they rank UofI on their list of interests, whether they've responded to emails, and whether they've visited UofI. The platform will also provide an easy to use interface 
for querying this information. This will make the hassle of dealing with a large number of prospective students easier; currently each department at the University of Iowa 
uses an Excel sheet for maintaining this information.
